# `docs/dev_docs`

This is a directory for supplemental files used in developing the
documentation, but which is not used directly in the documentation. For
example, this is a place to store editable versions (preserving layers) of
images used in the documentation. The final versions (in jpg or png format)
should not be stored in here.
