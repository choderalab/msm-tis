Several of our notebooks serve to both illustrate some features of
OpenPathSampling as well as acting as tests of those behaviors. They are in
this directory.

* `langevin_integrator_check.ipynb`: Test and visually inspect that the toy
  engine's Langevin integrator gives the correct distributions.
* `test_snapshot_modifier.ipynb`: Test and visually inspect that the
  `RandomVelocities` snapshot modifier gives the correct distribution
* `test_cv.ipynb`
* `test_netcdfplus.ipynb`
* `test_openmm_integration.ipynb`
* `test_pyemma.ipynb`
* `test_snapshot.ipynb`
* `test_storageview.ipynb`
