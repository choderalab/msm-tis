Experimental analysis module.

The idea here is to simplify the vast majority of common analysis routines.
Interestingly, the process should also simplify a lot of calculation
preparation.

Goal: RETIS for a simple A->B transition (one direction) boils down to

>>> # things that would be hypothetically already set up
>>> import openpathsampling as paths
>>> engine = ??? something that sets up the MD engine
>>> storage = ??? something that sets up storage
>>> globalstate0 = ??? something that sets up initial trajectories
>>> orderparameter = paths.OP_Function("lambda", some_function)
>>>
>>> # from here, this is real code
>>> stateA = paths.LambdaVolume(orderparameter, min=-infinity, max=0.0)
>>> stateB = paths.LambdaVolume(orderparameter, min=1.0, max=infinity)
>>> interfaces = paths.VolumeSet(orderparameter, min=-infinity, max=[0.0, 0.1, 0.2])
>>> transitionAB = paths.RETISTransition(stateA, stateB, orderparameter, interfaces, storage)
>>> retis_calc = PathSampling(
>>>     storage=storage,
>>>     engine=engine,
>>>     root_mover=transitionAB.default_movers(engine),
>>>     globalstate=globalstate0
>>> )
>>> retis_calc.run(nsteps=10000)
>>> tcp = transitionAB.total_crossing_probability()
>>> flow = transitionAB.replica_flow()
>>> rate = transitionAB.rate()

Note that once the total crossing probability has been calculated once, it
does not need to be recalculated as part of the rate. (Or, if it were
calculated as part of the rate, it would be already available on its own.)
In the order listed above, the time for the rate calculation is almost
entirely in determining the flux from the information in the minus mover.
